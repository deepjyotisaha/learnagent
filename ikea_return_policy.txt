IKEA’s return policy offers flexibility across different product categories. Customers can return or exchange items based on the following conditions:

1. **Unopened Products**: These can be returned or exchanged within **700 days** from the date of purchase, as long as they are in resalable condition and accompanied by a valid receipt.

2. **Opened Products**: These are eligible for return or exchange within **500 days**, provided they are not damaged and the customer has proof of purchase.

3. **Non-returnable Categories**:
   - Cut fabric
   - Custom-made items (e.g., countertops)
   - As-is merchandise
   - Products damaged due to misuse or improper handling

4. **Refund Method**: Refunds are issued to the original payment method. If the purchase was made using a gift card, the refund will be reissued on a new gift card.

5. **Online Purchases**: Items bought online can be returned either by mail or at a physical IKEA store.

6. **Returns Without Receipt**: IKEA may allow returns without a receipt, but a government-issued photo ID is typically required. Refunds in such cases may be issued as store credit.

Note: Return policies may vary slightly by country or region, so it’s recommended to check with your local IKEA store for specific details.
